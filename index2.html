                    <p>Major population centers often see the development of universities and cultural institutions impossible with smaller groups of people. These advanced economies develop into hubs of innovation and entertainment which dominate their region of space.</p>
                    <p>Humans can live anywhere with more than a tenth of Earthâ€™s gravity and while habitats and spacecraft easily provide quarter-G and more, the comfort of rock under your feet draws people to settle anywhere they can get it naturally. Many people call orbital habitats home, but just as many view them as temporary living arrangements before they retire somewhere solid.</p>

                <h1>Ignisato Hegemony</h1>
                <p>By 2167, humanity has spread across the Solar System. This expansion was driven by ignisato, an alien species with technology far beyond ours. Following first contact, we were flooded with wondrous technologies while our institutions eroded in an economic upheaval known by the survivors as the Uplift.</p>
                <p>Despite advances on many fronts, runaway complexity and ignisato influence leaves many feeling their lives are not their own. Struggling to adjust to their guidance, we race to the stars and strive to understand the world we find ourselves in, including the arcane technologies that make it possible.</p>
